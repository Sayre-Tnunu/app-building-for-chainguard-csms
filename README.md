# App Building for Chainguard TSMs

Purpose of this class material is to soft ramp foundational computer concepts for technical facing Chainguard ICs and managers, in workshop format.

Q: Why?

A: Hands-on experience helps with credibility when dealing with technical clients. And a little goes a long way. 

Bridging the gap between business concerns and technical concerns is valuable to our clients while keeping the main focus on relationships and account management.

Immersing in the technical side just a little more makes it much easier to get tha credibility and increase overall Chainguard value without adding more head count.
