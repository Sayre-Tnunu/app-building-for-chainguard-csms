# App Building for Chainguard TSMs

---

### Class Goal

Understand how Chainguard factory works

Be familiar with underlying concepts like bach commands, git, docker, package managers, and CI

---

### Prerequisites:

- Mac Laptop
  - A web browser - Chrome (or a Chrome-based browser like Brave) is probably best for this class
- [Create a GitHub account if you don't already have one](https://github.com/login)
  - Ensure it is connected to chainguard GH orgs
- A Chainguard account
- [A google cloud account (through chainguard)](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
  - Ensure you have access to [Google Cloud Shell](https://shell.cloud.google.com/?hl=en_US&fromcloudshell=true&show=terminal)

### Following Instructions

Please follow the documented and stated instructions as closely as possible.  This will help mitigate issues that arise due to funky configurations.  As mentioned above, we'll be stitching together a number of tools.  This means that the labs are very inter-dependent, and an innocent deviation in an early lab could complicate a later lab.

I encourage all students to experiment and explore the material.  Making it your own and having fun with it will probably increase the functional utility of this class immensely.  I'm happy to help with any extracurricular questions and/or interests related to the material, but please try the extra stuff after completing the suggested stuff.  And maybe in a different subdirectory.  :)
