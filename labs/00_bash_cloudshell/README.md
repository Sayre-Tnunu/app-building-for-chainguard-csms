  - Q: 
  
  Why is 'chroot' command important for Chainguard?

  - `chroot` ‚Äì Run a command with a different root directory  
    This is used to "jail" a process in a different filesystem view. Common in minimal container-like setups, or Linux-from-scratch systems. Requires root access and caution.

### Filesystem, Directories, and Navigation

Open your terminal (zshell terminal for MacOS, Bash terminal for Linux)

![image](zshell.png?)


When you first open it, you should see your prompt:

**anthony.sayre@AnthonySayres-MacBook-Pro ~ %**

Q: What is **~**?

A: **~** (tildae) is shorthand for your 'home' directory

See what the longhand for your home directory is by typing:

```bash
pwd
```
> 'pwd' stands for 'print working directory', it will 'print' the lon version of the /path/to/whatever/directory you are currently in

for MacOS, 'home' is: `/Users/username`  

for Linux OS, 'home' is: `/home/username`

Q: What do we mean when we say 'home', 'directory', or 'path'?

A: **Understanding the Linux directory structure (a set of organized folders):**

![image](linuxdir2.png?)


[The Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS)](https://www.howtogeek.com/117435/htg-explains-the-linux-directory-structure-explained/)



No matter what kind of computer your application is running on (HW, VM, Container), it will be using a file system...
![image](filesystems-allthewaydown2.png?)

Navigate around a little from your terminal prompt:

  <strong>Advanced, "ask AI" questions</strong></summary>

Q:

What types of things use an Operating System (OS) and file systems? Split the answer under three main types: Hardware devices, VMs, and Containers and describe how the OS for each interacts with the linux hierarchical file system?

I am a customer-facing Chainguard colleague just starting to learn Linux, bash, Git, and containers, so keep the answer basic
</details>

### Navigate around a little...

```bash
cd ..
```
> - Note: **'cd'** means 'change directory', 
> - **'..'** means 'one level above where you are in the hierarchy'

Q: Now what does your prompt show?

A: **.../Users %**

##### Make a new directory to house your coursework

```shell
mkdir ~/chainguard-app-building
```

> `mkdir` is the command to make a new directory

- `chainguard-app-building` is the new directory we're creating.  `~/chainguard-app-building` is the full path of the new directory.  Again the tildae (~) is short-hand for /Users/your_user_name so...

`/Users/your_user_name/chainguard-app-building` 

is the same thing as...

`~/chainguard-app-building`


---
#### Absolute vs relative paths

*Absolute:* Navigate from a fixed point (root)

*Relative:* Navigate from where you are in the directory (your user's active working directory)

Btw, where *am* I in the directory?

Use `pwd` command to figure it out:

```bash
pwd
```

If you have not changed directories yet, you should still be in your "home" directory and the result of the command will look like this: 

```bash
# on MACOS...
/Users/anthonysayre
```
 
or this...

```bash
# on most Linux OS...
/Home/anthonysayre
```


Ensure you are in your "home" directory and make a new sub-directory in it

```shell
cd ~
mkdir chainguard-app-building
```

#### Navigate to the new directory (`cd` command)


```shell
# Use the full path
cd ~/chainguard-app-building
# or
cd /home/$USER/chainguard-app-building
# or
cd $HOME/chainguard-app-building

# Use the relative path
# First, make sure you're in your home directory
cd
# or
cd ~
# Second, use the relative path to get to your new directory
cd chainguard-app-building

# Use tab completion. Type a part of the word "chainguard"...
cd chaing # before you hit 'enter', press 'tab' key
```

*Explanation:*
- Use the absolute path to get *from root* to any directory or file on your filesystem
- Use the relative path to get *from your users current working directory* to any directory or file
- Tab autocompletion is highly recommended
- Note that the shell environment gives us many variables by default.  `$USER` is one such variable:

command:

```bash
echo $USER 
```

results:

```bash
anthony.sayre
```

You can see all the environment variables with the `env` command:

command:

```bash
env
```

result:
```bash

```

*Dollar sign $:*
- Dollar sign -->   `$` indicates that we want the *value* of the variable here:
  - `echo $Your_Variable_Here`
- Example, create a custom variable of your own for this envirionment, go to your z-shell terminal and type this:

```bash
NAME=Frodo
```

This sets `$NAME` to `Frodo`

Ensure it worked:

command:

```bash
echo $NAME
```

result:

```bash
Frodo
```


##### Examine the new directory

```shell
# List the contents of the directory
ls
# And again in 'list' (-l) format
ls -l
# And again showing a 'list' (-l) of 'all' (-a) files (including normally hidden files)
ls -la
```

*Explanation:*
- With the `ls -la` command options, you'll see `.` and `..`
- `.` is shorthand for "current directory"
- `..` is shorthand for the parent directory

---

### Environment Management

##### Shell-wide environment

When you want a configuration available to you no matter where you are on the system, you can set an environment variable in your `~/.zshrc` file.  Because this file is loaded every time you log in, you'll always have it available.

We're all going to pick a unique [MacGuffin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacGuffin) that will identify resources we create in our shared environment.

```shell
# Choose a unique MacGuffin to identify your resources.
# To be safe, use all lower case letters (no numbers or special chars)
echo 'export MACGUFFIN=maltesefalcon' >> ~/.zshrc
# EDIT this expression before running it:
# - remove the '# ' at the beginning
# - replace 'maltesefalcon' with your unique MacGuffin: 'ring', 'rug', 'time', or whatever
# echo "export MACGUFFIN='maltesefalcon'" >> ~/.zshrc

# print the contents of the .zshrc file to console, to ensure the command worked
cat ~/.zshrc 

# Tell your shell to re-read your .zshrc file
source ~/.zshrc

# Verify
echo $MACGUFFIN
```

#### Chainguard at command line

Ensure chainctl is [installed locally](https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainctl-usage/how-to-install-chainctl/)

[WIP]

Understanding these concepts can help with troubleshooting
> #### [install a chainguard tool manually](https://)

```shell

# the path env variable
env
cat ~/.zshrc
# helped me get Chainguard license to text tool up and running on a system where it did not work properly out of the box

```
[/WIP]

### Self-Study and/or Extra Credit

### More notes on directories and the filesystem

##### An Unusual Class Convention

> In this class, you will find instructions like this:

```shell
touch ~/chainguard-app-building/mywebserver/deploy/Chart.yaml
```
> This command should fail because the subdirectory 'mywebserver' has not been created yet

> You can do two commands on a single terminal command by using '&&'. The below compound command is a combo of `mkdir` and `touch` commands:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/chainguard-app-building/mywebserver/deploy/ && touch ~/chainguard-app-building/mywebserver/deploy/Chart.yaml
```

The command should work this time

```bash
open -a TextEdit ~/chainguard-app-building/mywebserver/deploy/Chart.yaml
```

We used absolute paths for this

Sometimes we use absolute paths because it's exceptionally clear, and it will work even if you've wandered into a different directory at some point

If you prefer to type instead of copy/paste, something like this will yield the same results:

Use 'tab' to navigate through the `cd` command....

```shell
cd ~/chainguard-app-building/mywebserver/deploy
touch Chart.yaml
open -a TextEdit Chart.yaml
```

##### Tildae
- In Bash, `~` is a shortcut meaning "this user's home directory"
- So when the user `fbaggins` is logged in to a system, `mkdir ~/chainguard-app-building` is a shortcut for `mkdir /home/fbaggins/chainguard-app-building`.  (Probably.  Frodo's home directory could be somewhere else.)

### Command tricks

##### Autocomplete

- Try using the `Tab` key to autocomplete paths or commands
  - Type `cd ~/sn` without pressing Enter.  Press `Tab` instead.
  - Try typing `echo $MACG` and pressing `Tab`.

##### Command history

- You can type the up and down arrows to cycle through previous commands
- Bash variables
  - `!!` will re-run the last command
  - `!$` or `$_` will insert the last argument of the previous command:

    ```shell
    touch Chart.yaml
    open -a TextEdit !$
    ```

  - `!<search_string>` will immediately re-run the most recent command **starting** with `<search_string>` (risky, but handy for non-destructive things like `!edit` or `!vim`)
  - `!?<search_string>` will immediately re-run the most recent command **containing**  `<search_string>` (risky)
  - Some shells (like ZSH) will help protect you by expanding these found commands at the prompt; you have to hit Enter again to run them.
- CTRL+R
  - To search for and re-run a previous command, press CTRL+R, then type part of the command you want to re-run
  - A matching command should appear
  - Press CTRL+R again to cycle through earlier matching commands
